# This is a BETA book

This book is being made in an agile way. I will update this book often expanding its contents and revising the current text. Since some APIs are still being implemented by Firefox OS its a good practice to make sure you're reading an up to date version of this book.

Differently from some other technical authors that try to exclude themselves from the text, here you will find many parts where I express my personal opinion and make decisions that may be different than what other programmers would do. I will try to make it clear when I am giving my opinion and when I am talking facts. Anyway, if there is an error in what I am saying, I will revise the text and update the book.

I am writing this book in my spare time and distributing it under a *Creative Commons License* for **free** using [Leanpub](http://leanpub.com). Writing a book requires a lot of work and I would like to dedicate more time in my life for this type of activity. For those that think that this book is useful (or cool) may move the price slider on Leanpub download page from zero to any desired amount to give me some bucks. Those that would rather donate using PayPal, I can receive donations under the *agarzia@mac.com* account. Regardless of donations, you should fill your email on the download form to make sure that once the book is updated you will receive a notice.

# Who should read this book

Esse livro é destinado para pessoas com conhecimentos intermediários de HTML, CSS e JavaScript que desejam construir aplicativos móveis utilizando tecnologias web. Ensinar HTML, CSS e JavaScript estão fora do escopo desse livro porém eu forneço links para bons livros de referência para quem precisar de uma forcinha.

This book is written for readers with an intermediate knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript who wants to build mobile applications using web technologies. Teaching HTML, CSS and JavaScript is beyond the scope of this book. I will give you links for good reference books though.

# Best Practices vs Beginner Friendliness 

Experienced developers will notice that sometimes I don't follow all the good practices in the source code of the examples of this book. Even though I am avoiding anti-patterns in here, I am trying to keep the use of immediate functions and other similar practices to a minimum. The main reason for that is to make the source code beginner friendly since this is an introductory book. Seasoned programmers will know when and how to change things while beginner coders will be able to understand whats is going on. All code here works and as I update this book I may revisit the code and use more and more best practices depending on the readers feedback.

If you want to dive deeper in the world of high quality JavaScript coding here are some good books.

# Version Changes

## Version 0.1

This is the first version of this book. I am yet to run this through an editor and was not revised for typos, grammar mistakes and general bad things. English is not my first language so please correct me when I am wrong. What you're reading here begun on the 20th of August of 2013 as a quick guide to be distributed at [BrazilJS Conference](http://braziljs.com.br/) that happened on the 22nd and 23rd. So you're basically reading a quick draft written in two days.

I am using the [Leanpub](http://leanpub.com) system to write this book. This system allows me to iterate quickly and manage this project while keeping me sane. This version is a quasi-literal translation from the original in Portuguese.
